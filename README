This is a RGB color specs for LS_COLOR and PS1.
This is tested at:
echo $SHELL
/bin/bash
echo $TERM
xterm-256color

The fonts directory is only needed for PS1. 
If you only need the LS_COLOR, comment the blocks for PS1, and ignore the fonts dir.
If you want to use PS1, copy the content of fonts dir to ~/.fonts and run fc-cache.


Hope you will like it.

#INSTALL
